# React Demo "Expense App"

* First: Installing React with Vite;

* Second: Using React State & Working with Events:
    - Passing Data "State" From Parent to Child;
    - Listening to Events & Working with Event Handlers;
    - Adding Form Inputs;
    - Listening to User Input;
    - Working with Multiple States "through some methods";
    - Updating State That Depends On The Previous State;
    - Alternative Creating A Shared Handler Function;
    - Handling Form Submission;
    - Adding Two-Way Binding;
    - Lifting State Up "Child-to-Parent Component Communication" (Bottom-up);
    - Derived  Computed State;
    - Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components & Stateless vs Stateful Components;
    - Also, Using {props.children} in Card Component;
    
    # Until now, we have Two main components "Expenses & NewExpense"; 
    - Expenses have "ExpensesFilter & ExpenseItem which have date, amount & title".
    - NewExpense has "ExpenseForm";

* Third: Rendering Lists & Conditional Content: 
    - Rendering Lists of Data;
    - Using Stateful Lists;
    - Adding Keys to New Expenses;
    - Outputting Conditional Content "if the selected year doesn't show any expense";
    - Adding ExpenseList File within the Conditional Return Statements;

    # Until now, we have three main components "UI, Expenses & NewExpense"; 
    - UI has "Card";
    - Expenses have "ExpensesFilter, Expense List to map the ExpenseItem which have a date, amount & title" and Showing no expense found in matter.
    - NewExpense has "ExpenseForm";
